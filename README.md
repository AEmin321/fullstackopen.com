Welcome to my Fullstack Open repository! This repository contains all the assignments and projects I completed during the Fullstack Open course offered by the University of Helsinki. Fullstack Open is an awesome resource for learning modern web development, covering a wide range of topics from frontend to backend, including JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and much more.
